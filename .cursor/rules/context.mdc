Here's a context paragraph for your expense tracking app:

"MoneyWhisper is a personal expense tracking app designed for simplicity and efficiency. Unlike conventional finance apps that require multiple inputs and navigation, MoneyWhisper lets you log expenses with just a voice command. Simply tap a button and speak your purchase—like "curd for 20 rupees"—and the app instantly categorizes and records it. Built with AI voice recognition, it understands natural language, eliminates the friction of manual entry, and creates meaningful spending insights without overwhelming you with complex features. MoneyWhisper is the minimalist solution for those who want financial awareness without the hassle of traditional budgeting tools.
